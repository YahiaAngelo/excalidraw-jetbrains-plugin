<1> Where the web application sources are located. The `index.html` is merely a placeholder/template,
most the interesting application code is in the `src` directory. Notice the `<div id="root">` element that will be looked by `index.tsx`.
<2> The main entry point for the application, this somehow generates the HTML for the application. Imports `App` and will render the app in element `root` (notice `document.getElementById("root")`).
<3> The actual React application that plugs everything together. Imports `Excalidraw`.
<4> Interesting items from the https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases[Excalidraw release notes].
<5> Gradle script that drives _yarn_.
<6> Yarn specific config files (see https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored[doc]). The exact file name of `.yarn/release/yarn-1.22.19.cjs` is not important as it's declared in `build.gradle.kts`.
<7> Webapp dependencies, change stuff in `package.json`, `yarn.lock` should be updated on next `yarn install` (or by the dependency bot).
<8> Since it's a typescript webapp, the `tsconfig.json` file is used to configure the compiler.
<9> The `config-overrides.js` file is used to *override the default configuration of the React build* in order to ship the web-app with *source-maps* (otherwise it's a *pain* to debug in the *JCEF browser*), also the optimizer is disabled of the same reason, and it's not needed since the assets are served locally.
<10> Gulp is used to customize the content of the final artefact, like packaging the actual-app as a single file and to include the *source-maps* in the build.

== Basic tasks

This project is a web-app, most commands implies `yarn`, and they do work, but if `yarn` is not installed
it's possible to rely on the gradle commands

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
a|*Yarn* +
(assumes working dir is `excalidraw-assets/`)
a|*gradle* +
(assumes working dir is repository root)

|`yarn install`
|`./gradlew installFrontend`

|`yarn start`
|`./gradlew runYarnStart`

|===


To debug the web app without running IntelliJ, run `./gradlew :excalidraw-assets:yarnRunStart`

Then hit http://localhost:3000/ in the browser, you should see the Excalidraw interface.

The exchange with the plugin is _**message based**_, so in order to trigger saving or loading a file we need to pass a message.

E.g. to save the current sketch, pass the `save-as-svg` message in the browser console via `postMessage`.

[source, javascript]
----
window.postMessage({ type: "save-as-svg", exportConfig:{}, correlationId: crypto.randomUUID() })
window.postMessage({ type: "theme-change", theme:"dark", correlationId: crypto.randomUUID() })
----

The Excalidraw assets app can also communicate back to the plugin by sending messages via `cefQuery`.
