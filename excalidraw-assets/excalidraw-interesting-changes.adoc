= Upgrade Excalidraw, interesting changes

== https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases/tag/v0.17.0[0.17.0]

> The `Ref` support has been removed in v0.17.0 so if you are using refs, please update the integration to use the `excalidrawAPI` https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7251[#7251].

> Additionally, `ready` and `readyPromise` from the API have been discontinued. These APIs were found to be superfluous, and as part of the effort to streamline the APIs and maintain simplicity, they were removed in version v0.17.0 https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7251[#7251].


== https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases/tag/v0.14.0[0.14.0]

> Expose https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/children-components/live-collaboration-trigger[`LiveCollaborationTrigger`] component. Replaces props.onCollabButtonClick https://togithub.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6104[#6104].
> `props.onCollabButtonClick` is now removed. You need to render the main menu item yourself, and optionally also render the `<LiveCollaborationTrigger>` component using https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderTopRightUI[`renderTopRightUI`] prop if you want to retain the canvas button at top-right.

> Expose util https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.12.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exportToClipboard[`exportToClipboard`] which allows to copy the scene contents to clipboard as `svg`, `png` or `json` https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5103[#5103].

> The https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.12.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exportToBlob[`exportToBlob`] utility now supports the `exportEmbedScene` option when generating a `png` image https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5047[#5047].

== https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases/tag/v0.11.0[0.11.0]

> https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.11.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exportToBlob[`exportToBlob`]
now automatically sets `appState.exportBackground` to `true` if exporting to
`image/jpeg` MIME type (to ensure that alpha channel is not compressed to
black color) https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4342[#4342].


> Changes to `exportToCanvas` util function https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4321[#4321]:
>
> * Add `maxWidthOrHeight?: number` attribute.
> * `scale` returned from `getDimensions()` is now optional (default to `1`).


> Image support added for host https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4011[PR]
>
> General notes:
>
> * File data are encoded as DataURLs (base64) for portability reasons.
>
> https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.11.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#onLibraryChange[ExcalidrawAPI]:
>
> * added `getFiles()` to get current `BinaryFiles` (`Record<FileId, BinaryFileData>`). It may contain files that aren't referenced by any element, so if you're persisting the files to a storage, you should compare them against stored elements.
>
> Excalidraw app props:
>
> * added `generateIdForFile(file: File)` optional prop so you can generate your own ids for added files.
> * `onChange(elements, appState, files)` prop callback is now passed BinaryFiles as third argument.
> * `onPaste(data, event)` data prop should contain `data.files` (`BinaryFiles`) if the elements pasted are referencing new files.
> * `initialData` object now supports additional files (`BinaryFiles`) attribute.
>
> Other notes:
>
> * `.excalidraw` files may now contain top-level `files` key in format of `Record<FileId, BinaryFileData>` when exporting any (image) elements.
> * Changes were made to various export utilities exported from the package so that they take `files`, you can refer to the docs for the same.

> Add `onLinkOpen` prop which will be triggered when clicked on element hyperlink if present https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4694[#4694.]

> BREAKING CHANGE
>
> The `Appearance` type is now removed and renamed to `Theme` so `Theme` type needs to be used.

== https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases/tag/v0.9.0[0.9.0]

> https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.9.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#restore[restore(data, localAppState, localElements)]
and https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.9.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#restoreElements[restoreElements(elements, localElements)]
now take `localElements` argument which will be used to ensure existing elements'
versions are used and incremented. This fixes an issue where importing the same
file would resolve to elements with older versions, potentially causing issues
when reconciling https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3797[#3797].
>
> BREAKING CHANGE
>
> ** `localElements` argument is mandatory (can be `null`/`undefined`) if using TypeScript.


> Expose https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.9.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#loadLibraryFromBlobY[`loadLibraryFromBlob`],
https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.9.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#loadFromBlob[`loadFromBlob`],
and https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.9.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#getFreeDrawSvgPath[`getFreeDrawSvgPath`]
https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3764[#3764].


> Support `appState.exportEmbedScene` attribute in https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/v0.9.0/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exportToSvg[`exportToSvg`] which allows to embed the scene data https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3777[#3777].
>
> BREAKING CHANGE
>
> ** The attribute `metadata` is now removed as `metadata` was only used to embed scene data which is now supported with the `appState.exportEmbedScene` attribute.
> ** `exportToSvg` now resolves to a promise which resolves to svg of the exported drawing.


> * Added prop `UIOptions.canvasActions.saveAsImage` to show/hide the _Save as image_ button in the canvas actions. Defaults to `true` hence the _Save as Image_ button is rendered https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3662[#3662].
